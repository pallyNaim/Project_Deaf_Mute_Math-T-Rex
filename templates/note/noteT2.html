                    <h2>Elapsed Time â€“ How Much Time Has Passed</h2>
                    <p>Elapsed time is all about figuring out how much time has passed between two events. If you start
                        doing your homework at 3:00 PM and finish at 4:30 PM, you can find the elapsed time by looking
                        at the clock. It's like counting the hours and minutes that went by. In this case, it took 1
                        hour and 30 minutes to finish your homework.</p>
